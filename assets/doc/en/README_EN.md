## How to download

Click [Releases](https://github.com/KIYI671/AhabAssistantLimbusCompany/releases) and download the file called 【AALC-Vx.x.x】 in the latest version, unzip it and run AALC.exe.

Because of the lack of technical power, I also engaged in GUI and used third-party OCR, so the file size is relatively large

## Instructions for use

### [A maneuver that even Don Quixote could learn](/assets/doc/en/How_to_use_EN.md)

### Other Notes

During script execution you can use **CTRL+Q** keys to terminate the script process (this may cause problems when the script is restarted, which can be solved by restarting the script program).

At the same time **ALT+P** can pause the script, **ALT+R** can resume the script

There is nothing to explain, what you see is what you get.

If you find any problems (except for the team numbering problem below), you can report them to [Issue](https://github.com/KIYI671/AhabAssistantLimbusCompany/issues).

Of course, you are also welcome to submit [Pull Request](https://github.com/KIYI671/AhabAssistantLimbusCompany/pulls)

### Theme package weight setting

When the script is run once, a _"theme_pack_list.yaml"_ file is automatically created, which is used to set the weight of the theme package</br>
After opening it with Notepad or other text editors, you can configure the weight of the theme package according to the format, or add the theme package to recognize the text

#### Modify the process
- Run the AALC.exe once first (for new users)
- A theme_pack_list.yaml file appears in the AALC folder
- Modify theme_pack_list.yaml file
- Restart AALC after modification

The file format is shown in the following picture.

### Running in the background

- This section is currently unsupported for this language.
- **Need to run in the background or have multiple monitors try [Remote Local Multi-User Desktop](https://www.bilibili.com/read/cv24286313/)**
- **All related files in the above tutorials: [download link](https://github.com/CHNZYX/asu_version_latest/releases)**
- **Related files can also be obtained by going to the tutorial author's [Home - Dynamic Page](https://space.bilibili.com/26715033/dynamic) from the top**.

## Attention!!!

- It is recommended to run with resolutions of 1920 * 1080 and 2160 * 1440</br> The screen is less than 1920 * 1080 is not tested, it is not recommended to use it at resolutions less than that
- **Please set Material Quality and Render Ratio in Settings-Image to High, Normal FPS and Combat FPS to 60, and Post-Processing to Off** to facilitate software recognition. If the performance of the device cannot be met, please also try to set the **rendering ratio to high**, otherwise the software may have difficulty in recognizing it.
- The game program will be set to window mode after the script starts, and if there is a behavior of switching to the full screen and then exiting in the middle, it is normal behavior, so there is no need to worry
- If you have enabled the performance display feature of Steam or other software, you should try not to obscure the game screen, as this may cause problems with the scripting process
